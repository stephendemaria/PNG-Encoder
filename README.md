# PNG-Encoder
This program is a PNG encoder that takes a PNG file, input.png, and produces a file, compressed.png, as output.  Update the string, sourceImagePath, with the appropriate location for your input image.  Updates to this program that I am working on include: *  The implementation of the parallel processing of image blocks to speed up the encoder. *  The creation of a windows graphical user interface for the program.  input.png image credit: pixel2013 https://pixabay.com/images/id-4777410/  Simplified Pixabay License Our license empowers creators and protects our community.
